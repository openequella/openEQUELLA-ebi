# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the EBI (openEQUELLA Bulk Importer)!
Contributions of all kinds are welcome — bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, and issue reports.

## Development Setup

For a user-focused overview and release links, see [README.md](README.md). This guide covers contributor and maintainer workflows.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- wxPython 4.x
- On Linux, GTK+ 3 development libraries are required for wxPython
- PyInstaller if you need to produce standalone packages locally

Creating a virtual environment is recommended to avoid dependency conflicts:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note on Linux**: You may need to install GTK+ 3 development libraries before installing `wxPython`.

Linux system packages commonly required for wxPython:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential gettext python3-dev libgtk-3-dev
```

If you need to build standalone packages locally, install PyInstaller as well:

```bash
pip3 install PyInstaller
```

### Running the App Locally

From the repository root, launch the GUI application with:

```bash
python3 source/ebi.py
```

### Code Structure Overview

- `source/ebi.py`: Main entry point script that launches the GUI.
- `source/MainFrame.py`: Core wxPython GUI definitions and flow wiring.
- `source/Engine.py`: CSV processing state and data orchestration.
- `source/RowProcessor.py`: Row-to-item processing logic using a `RowContext`.
- `source/equellaclient41.py`: SOAP API client for communicating with an openEQUELLA instance.

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub and clone your fork locally.
2. **Create a branch** for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-or-fix
   ```
3. **Make your changes** and verify they work by running EBI from source (see [Running the App Locally](#running-the-app-locally)).
4. **Commit** with a clear, descriptive message.
5. **Push** your branch to your fork and open a **Pull Request** against `master`, which reflects the latest development state.
6. Respond to any review feedback.

## Code Conventions

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guidelines for Python code.
- Keep changes focused — one logical change per pull request makes review easier.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.

## Testing

EBI does not currently have an automated test suite.
Before submitting a pull request, manually verify your changes by running EBI from source:

```bash
python3 source/ebi.py
```

Exercise any workflows affected by your change (e.g. import, export, update, delete) against a running openEQUELLA instance to confirm correct behaviour.

## Packaging and CI

Standalone packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux are built automatically via GitHub Actions.
You do not need to build packages locally to contribute code changes.

### Automated Builds (GitHub Actions)

The CI workflow automatically compiles all three standalone versions (Windows, macOS, Linux) for supported pull requests and pushes to the active development branch. The resulting packages are uploaded as GitHub Actions build artifacts for those workflow runs. On tag pushes, the workflow also publishes these packages as release assets in GitHub Releases.

### Manual Compilation

For local testing or manual builds, compile each standalone version on its matching operating system: Windows on Windows, Linux on Linux, and macOS on macOS.

#### Compiling a Windows Standalone Package

Use a Windows computer with Python 3.8+, wxPython, and PyInstaller installed.

Navigate to the `package-win` directory and run `package.bat`. It creates `ebi.zip` containing the packaged application.
`package.bat` does the following automatically:
1. Validates Python and PyInstaller dependencies.
2. Removes any previous packages from the working folder.
3. Invokes `setup.py`, which uses PyInstaller to generate a standalone package in a folder called `dist`. The `dist` folder contains `ebi.exe`, which is the standalone Windows EBI executable.
4. Renames the `dist` folder to `ebi`.
5. Copies the source files into the `ebi\source` folder for reference.
6. Invokes `package.py`, which zips the `ebi` folder into `ebi.zip`.

#### Compiling a Linux Standalone Package

Use a Linux computer with Python 3.8+, wxPython, and PyInstaller installed.

Navigate to the `package-linux` directory and run `bash package.sh`. It creates `ebi.zip` containing the packaged application compatible with Linux environments.
`package.sh` performs the same operations automatically as its Windows counterpart (`package.bat`), yielding an ELF executable (`ebi`) inside `ebi/ebi` rather than an `.exe`, and finally zipping it into `ebi.zip`.

#### Compiling a macOS Standalone Package

Use a Macintosh computer with Python 3.8+, wxPython 4.2+, and PyInstaller installed.

Navigate to the `package-mac` directory and run `bash ebi-package.command` (or make it executable and run it). It creates `ebi.dmg` in the `dist` subfolder.
`ebi-package.command` does the following:
1. Validates dependencies and checks for PyInstaller.
2. Removes previous builds from the `build` and `dist` directories.
3. Invokes `setup.py`, which uses PyInstaller to generate a macOS application bundle (`ebi.app`) inside the `dist` folder.
4. Copies the launcher script wrapper into the `ebi.app` package.
5. Creates a disk image `ebi.dmg` in the `dist` folder from `ebi.app` using `hdiutil`.
